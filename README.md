# authenticated-capture
The authentication of any two dimensional or three dimensional object as the fisrt step of embedded security against fraud.
Agnostic capture of documents that require authentication as "the" original through algorthimic based three dimensional imaging sciences and secured as unique patterened, multi-patterned PKI's. May also be applied to any three dimensioinal object(s) of value or need of future physical authentication as the original. Thsi is a major hole in creating authetic physical identification of any and all content deemed to be that of a leagal nature, subject to vector- based fraud manuipulation post capture.  The original can always be substantiated 100% or with statitical confidence limits depending upon the application and system type (ie. CRM, ECM, e-Discovery, DAM, Web pages, etc.) post-authentication using any post capture processing software or tools to prevent fraud or manipulatiuon of text, objects, fields, synbols, hidden securtity marks, security threads, micro print, erasures, signature(s), encrpyted physical codes embeded, spatial continuities, etc.
